Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree Project Submission: Finding Lane Lines

## Overview
This repository contains the code and report for a piece of coursework submitted for the Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree. In this project, I write code to identify lane lines on the road, first in an image, and later in a video stream.
